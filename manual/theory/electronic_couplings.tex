The electronic transfer integral\index{electronic coupling}\index{transfer integral|see{electronic coupling}} element $J_{ij}$ entering the Marcus rates in \equ{marcus} is defined as
\begin{equation}
   J_{ij} = \left\langle \phi_i \left\vert \hat{H} \right\vert \phi_j \right\rangle ,
\label{equ:TI}
\end{equation}
where $\phi_i$ and $\phi_j$ are diabatic wavefunctions, localized on molecule $i$ and $j$ respectively, participating in the charge transfer, and $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian of the formed dimer. Within the frozen-core approximation, the usual choice for the diabatic wavefunctions $\phi_i$\index{diabatic states} is the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) in case of hole transport, and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in the case of electron transfer, while $\hat{H}$ is an effective single particle Hamiltonian, e.g. Fock or Kohn-Sham operator of the dimer. As such, $J_{ij}$ is a measure of the strength of the electronic coupling of the frontier orbitals of monomers mediated by the dimer interactions. 

Intrinsically, the transfer integral is very sensitive to the molecular arrangement, i.e. the distance and the mutual orientation of the molecules participating in charge transport. Since this arrangement can also be significantly influenced by static and/or dynamic disorder~\cite{baessler_charge_1993,troisi_charge-transport_2006,troisi_charge_2009,mcmahon_organic_2010,vehoff_charge_2010},
it is essential to calculate $J_{ij}$ explicitly for each hopping pair within a realistic morphology. Considering that the number of dimers for which \equ{TI} has to be evaluated is proportional to the number of molecules times their coordination number, computationally efficient and at the same time quantitatively reliable schemes are required.
